# Hi, I'm Vincent

I'm a Business Analytics student at California State University, Northridge, graduating in May 2026. I build end-to-end data pipelines and analytics systems using the modern data stack.

I'm currently seeking **Analytics Engineer** roles where I can turn messy data into clear business insights.

## Projects

### E-Store Analytics
*End-to-end analytics pipeline processing 400M+ e-commerce events*

Built a production-grade system from ingestion through visualization: automated data loading from Cloud Storage to BigQuery, Dagster orchestration, and dbt transformations. The analytics layer includes RFM customer segmentation, churn analysis, and conversion funnel metrics—the kind of business intelligence that drives retention and marketing decisions. CI/CD via GitHub Actions handles automated testing and deployment.

### Yelp Restaurant Analytics
*Predictive modeling for restaurant ratings*

Engineered 31 features from the Yelp Open Dataset using dbt, including reviewer behavior patterns, check-in trends, and geographic context. Tested whether sentiment analysis improved prediction accuracy and found that geographic features already captured competitive positioning signals—a useful lesson in avoiding redundant complexity.

### Littlefield Factory Sim Analytics
*Real-time reporting pipeline for operations simulation*

Developed a Python tool using Cloud Run, Cloud Scheduler, BigQuery, and Discord to automate data collection and reporting for the Littlefield Factory Simulation. Generated hourly dashboards tracking demand trends, station utilization, and team standings, enabling faster strategic decisions during the competition.
